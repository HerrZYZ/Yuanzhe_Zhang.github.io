We proposed a transaction allocation scheme, TxAllo, for reducing cross-shard transactions and optimizing workload balance in sharded blockchain systems. This paper first formalizes the blockchain problem into a novel graph partition problem. Then, we propose a new algorithm clusters frequent interacted addresses into the same shard and reduces cross-shard transactions from 98% to 17%.
