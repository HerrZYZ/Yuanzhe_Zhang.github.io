title: "TxAllo: Dynamic Transaction Allocation in Sharded Blockchain Systems"
collection: publications

excerpt: 'We proposed a transaction allocation scheme, TxAllo, for reducing cross-shard transactions and optimizing workload balance in sharded blockchain systems. It investigates a novel graph partition direction to cluster frequent interacted addresses into the same shard and reduces cross-shard transactions from 98% to 17%.'
