We proposed Mosaic, a distributed account allocation framework to parallel run allocation algorithm. Upon Mosaic, we further propose Pilot, a lightweight distributed algorithm, to guide the allocation. The efficiency is boosted by 104, while maintaining a similar accuracy to the state-of-the-art baselines.
