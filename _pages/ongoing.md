Blockchain × AI Agents:
-
  
**• AI Agents in Decentralized Ecosystem**

- With the rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), the concept of AI agents has emerged as a burgeoning area of research within AI research and application domains. Concurrently, the integration of AI agents into decentralized systems has fueled the growth of numerous startups and attracted substantial investment. We are exploring the decentralization of AI agent, specifically 1) how to co-own the AI agent, 2) how to integrate the AI agent into existing blockchain tools, e.g., DAOs, smart contracts and DeFi and 3) how to train and deploy LLMs off-chain and store essential information on-chain.

Blockchain Sharding × Graph Machine Learning:
-

**• A Fast Co-prediction-clustering Algorithm for Precise Allocation of Large-scale Addresses in Sharded Blockchain.**

- The previous allocation methods simply utilize historical transaction patterns to instead of future transactions, ignoring the transaction dynamics. We propose a unified co-prediction-clustering algorithm for the allocation problem in blockchain sharding.
  
**• Smart Contract Multi-input Multi-output Transactions Allocation in Sharded Blockchain.**
  
- Multi-input multi-output transactions are common due to the existence of smart contracts. However, existing allocation methods in sharding can not tackle with them appropriately. We propose a fast hypergraph partition algorithm for the allocation problem in blockchain sharding.

Blockchain Sharding × Graph Machine Learning:
-

**• Distributed Account Allocation Framework and Algorithm for Blockchain Sharding**

(CORE ranking-A, under review) Submitted to IEEE ICDCS 2025

- We proposed Mosaic, a distributed account allocation framework to parallel run allocation algorithm. Upon Mosaic, we further propose Pilot, a lightweight distributed algorithm, to guide the allocation. The efficiency is boosted by $$10^4$$, while maintaining a similar accuracy to the state-of-the-art baselines.
