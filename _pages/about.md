Hello! Iâ€™m Yuanzhe Zhang, a Ph.D. student of computer science at the University of Sydney advised by A. Prof. Jiangshan Yu (ARC DECRA Fellow), A. Prof. Lijun Chang (ARC Future Fellow) and Prof. Shirui Pan (ARC Future Fellow).

My academic interests center around blockchain scalability, sharded blockchains, decentralized finance, decentralized exchange, large-scale graph processing, convex optimization, graph partition, data mining.

I am excited about the opportunities for collaboration and advancement in my field, and am eager to continue learning and contributing to the research community. If you are willing to learn more about my research or explore potential opportunities for collaboration, I would be honored if you could kindly reach out to me. Thank you for visiting!
