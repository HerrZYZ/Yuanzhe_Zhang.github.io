Blockchain Sharding Ã— Graph Machine Learning:
-

- **TxAllo: Dynamic Transaction Allocation in Sharded Blockchain Systems**

  - (CORE ranking-A*) **Yuanzhe Zhang**, Shirui Pan, Jiangshan Yu.

  - The 39th IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE 2023)

  - We proposed a transaction allocation scheme, TxAllo, for reducing cross-shard transactions and optimizing workload balance in sharded     blockchain systems. This paper first formalizes the blockchain problem into a novel graph partition problem. Then, we propose a new algorithm clusters frequent interacted addresses into the same shard and reduces cross-shard transactions from 98% to 17%.


Data Mining:
-

- **Correlation-aware Next Basket Recommendation using Graph Attention Networks**

  - (CORE ranking-A) **Yuanzhe Zhang**, Ling Luo, Jianjia Zhang et al.

  - The 27th International Conference on Neural Information Processing (ICONIP2020)

  - We developed an end-to-end model using graph attention networks to predict the next shopping basket by leveraging item correlations.


- **FCP Filter: A Dynamic Clustering-Prediction Framework for Customer Behavior**

  - (CORE ranking-A) **Yuanzhe Zhang**, Ling Luo, Yang Wang, Zhiyong Wang.

  - Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (PAKDD 2020)

  - We proposed a Bayesian nonparametric framework for customer behavior prediction and noise filtering.
